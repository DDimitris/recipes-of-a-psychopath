recipe:
  servings: 8 small pancakes
  prep: 5 - 10 minutes
  cook: 2 - 3 minutes
  ingredients_markdown: |-
    * 1 ripe banana
    * 2 large eggs, lightly beaten
    * Butter or oil, for cooking (optional)
  
    **Toppings**
  
    *Maple syrup, jam, powdered sugar, or any other toppings, for serving
  directions_markdown: |-
  
    1. Into a bowl, mash the banana.  
    2. Pour the eggs over the banana and stir until completely combined. 
    3. Heat a nonstick frying pan over medium heat. Melt a little butter or warm a little vegetable oil in the pan if desired.
    4. Drop about 2 tablespoons of batter into the pan. It should sizzle immediately â€” if not, turn up the heat slightly. Repeat with dropping more batter into the pan, leaving at least an inch or two between pancakes.
    5. Cook the pancakes until the bottoms look browned and golden when you lift a corner, about 1 minute.
    6. Flip the pancakes and cook for another minute or so.
    7. Transfer the cooked pancakes to a serving plate and cook the rest of the batter.

    \"These pancakes are best when eaten fresh off the griddle and still warm. Serve with maple syrup, honey, jam, or any extra toppings you'd like ;) \"
