  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Pre heat oven to 180°C.
    2. Chop all the veggies into small pieces and deep fry using a non-stick frying pan (you can add olive oil but it is not necessary because all of the veggies have their own liquids). Afterwards, put all of the veggies into a bowl to cool down for 5 mins.
    3. Crumble the feta cheese with your hands into a different bowl.
    4. Whisk the mix of egg whites, eggs, milk, salt, pepper and oregano into a different bowl.
    5. Add all of the ingredients into the bowl with the eggs and whisk the mix until all of the ingredients are merged.
    6. Pour the mix into an ovenproof dish and bake at 180°C for 30' - 35' (It doesn't hurt to keep an eye in the oven every now and then :) ).

Frittata is an egg-based Italian dish similar to an omelette or crustless quiche or scrambled eggs, enriched with additional ingredients such as meats, cheeses or vegetables. The word frittata is Italian and roughly translates to "fried".

The Italian word frittata derives from friggere and roughly means "fried". This was originally a general term for cooking eggs in a skillet, anywhere on the spectrum from fried egg, through conventional omelette, to an Italian version of the Spanish omelette, made with fried potato. Outside Italy, frittata was seen as equivalent to "omelette" until at least the mid-1950s.

This particular recipe has a twist. It is baked in the oven in order to reduce the overall caloric intake.
