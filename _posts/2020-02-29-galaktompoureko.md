    **For the custard filling**

    1. In a pot, add the milk and stevia, and transfer over medium heat until the milk comes to a boil.
    2. Add the semolina and stir with a hand whisk, until the cream thickens.
    3. Remove from the heat and add the vanillins, lemon zest, and mix.
    4. Add the yolks, salt, and mix.
    5. Transfer the custard into a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and place it into the refrigerator to cool for ~30'. Make sure that the plastic wrap touches the surface of the custard, so it does not make a crust while cooling.

    **How to assemble**

    6. Preheat the oven at 160Â°C Fan.
    7. Brush a baking pan with some melted butter.
    8. Start assembling the pie by spreading a sheet of phyllo dough in the pan and drizzle with some butter. Do not brush the butter straight on to the phyllo, drizzle it from above.
    9. Repeat the same process with the remainng 3 sheets of phyllo dough.
    10. Spread the custard on top and turn in the phyllo that is hanging over the edges. Drizzle with butter.
    11. Add 1 sheet over the custard, drizzling with melted butter in the same way as before.
    12. Carefully cover with the final sheet. Use your pastry brush to help you turn it inwards, towards the bottom of the pan to seal the sweet.
    13. Drizzle some melted butter over the top of the sweet and spray with some water.
    14. Score the top of the pie into 10-12 pieces and then cut into them.
    15. Bake for 1.5 hours or until golden brown and crunchy.

    **For the syrup**

    16. Pure the gelatin powder into some cold water (About 3 - 4tbsp of water is enough).
    17. Into a pot, boil the water, the cinnamon stick and the vanillins for 3'.
    18. Remove from the heat, add the stevia, the honey and whisk firmly.
    19. Remove the cinnamon stick and pure in the gelatin powder.
    20. Let it cool down until the galaktompoureko is cooked.
    21. When you remove the galaktompoureko from the oven, pure the syrup above immediately and let it cool down before you serve.
