Octopus in wine is a traditional greek food. Most of as choose this recipe before Easter in order to have a healthy diet during the Lent.

Octopus is rich in protein. 100 grams of octopus, contains ~13 grams of protein and a total of ~63 Kcal. I believe that is safe to categorize this food as a super food for those who try to build muscle. ;)

It is very easy and delicious!
