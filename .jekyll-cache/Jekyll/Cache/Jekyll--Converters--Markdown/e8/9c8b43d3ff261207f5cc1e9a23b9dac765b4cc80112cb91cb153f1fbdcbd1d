I"ô<p>Frittata is an egg-based Italian dish similar to an omelette or crustless quiche or scrambled eggs, enriched with additional ingredients such as meats, cheeses or vegetables. The word frittata is Italian and roughly translates to â€œfried.â€</p>

<p>The Italian word frittata derives from friggere and roughly means â€œfriedâ€. This was originally a general term for cooking eggs in a skillet, anywhere on the spectrum from fried egg, through conventional omelette, to an Italian version of the Spanish omelette, made with fried potato. Outside Italy, frittata was seen as equivalent to â€œomeletteâ€ until at least the mid-1950s.</p>

<p>This particular recipe has a twist. It is baked in the oven in order to reduce the overall caloric intake.</p>
