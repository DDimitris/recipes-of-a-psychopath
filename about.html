	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>I'm Dimitris Dedousis and welcome to my food diary. Every now and then i try out a new recipe and post it here to share it with the world. All of my recipes have been created based on my macros (protein/carbs/fats) as well as my caloric intake (yes i know im a psycho). Feel free to leave a comment (try not to hurt my feelings).</p>

	<p>I grew up in Denver, Colorado and learned to bake from my mother. After finishing highschool I started baking full time and selling baked goods at local markets. Now I work full-time at a bakery in San Francisco.</p>
